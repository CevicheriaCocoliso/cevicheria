						<div class="testimonial-card-text">Yesterday's crown preparation went great. I expected the same level of discomfort that I had experienced with another crown done by different dentist. Technique caused so much less difficulty that I went away with a smile on my face. </div>

						<div class="testimonial-card-text">Whitney showed up today early, not on time, but early, which was awesome, and took care of everything. Got the oil filter changed. Also, he found some other things that were possibly needing a little attention from him. It was a great service all around and we'll be calling him again, again, and again.</div>

						<div class="testimonial-card-text">The mechanic that came out to do the work, Whitney, has over 28, probably 30 years of auto repair experience and I felt very confident that he was able to do the job correctly and properly, which he did. So I'm very happy with the outcome. The bottom line was saving me over $200.</div>
